## What Do You Need

To get started, you'll need the following:

- A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- A text-editor or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- A web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge)

## Online Development Environment

**Can I code online?**

Yes, there are Online IDE's for that.

#### Online IDEs

- https://repl.it/
- https://playcode.io/
- https://stackblitz.com/
- https://codesandbox.io/
- https://jsfiddle.net/
- https://codepen.io/

We recommend these platforms for online coding, e.g. testing features, trying simple stuff

These platforms allow working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Some of these allow working with Frameworks, and working with server-side JavaScript with NodeJS.

## Local Development Environment

**Can I code locally on my computer?**

Yes, for that you'll need the following:

- An IDE.
- NodeJS, a JavaScript runtime environment for running and testing server-side code.
- NPM, a package manager for easy consumption of third-party JavaScript libraries.
- Git, a version control system, used for tracking code changes, and collaboration purposes.

#### Installing an IDE

- Visual Studio Code (Free): https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- Atom (Free): https://atom.io/
- Sublime Text (Paid): https://www.sublimetext.com/
- JetBrains WebStorm (Paid): https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/

We recommend Visual Studio Code, it's free and runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms.

#### Installing NodeJS & NPM

NPM is included in NodeJS installers.

- NodeJS (Windows & Mac): https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- NodeJS (Debian and Ubuntu based Linux): https://github.com/nodesource/distributions

On choosing between LTS (long-term-support) vs Current release, we prefer installing the LTS versions for stability.

More info here: https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/

- Test your local NodeJS executable by running `node --version`

```sh
user@group:~$ node --version
v14.4.0
```

- Test your local NPM executable by running `npm --version`

```sh
user@group:~$ npm --version
6.14.5
```

#### Installing Git

Git is pre-installed on some distributions of Linux and Mac.

- Git (Windows, Mac, and Linux): https://git-scm.com/downloads

- Test your local Git executable by running `git --version`

```sh
user@group:~$ git --version
git version 2.25.1
```
