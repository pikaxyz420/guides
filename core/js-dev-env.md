## What Do You Need

To get started, you'll need the following:

- A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- A text-editor or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- A web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge)

## Online Development Environment

**Can I code online?**

Yes, there are Online IDE's for that.

#### Online IDEs

- https://repl.it/
- https://playcode.io/
- https://stackblitz.com/
- https://codesandbox.io/
- https://jsfiddle.net/
- https://codepen.io/

We recommend these platforms for online coding, e.g. testing features, trying simple stuff

These platforms allow working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Some of them allow working with third-party libraries, others allow working with server-side JavaScript (with NodeJS).

## Local Development Environment

**Can I code locally on my computer?**

Yes, for that you'll need the following:

- A computer, a text-editor / IDE, and a web browser.
- NodeJS, a JavaScript runtime environment for running and testing server-side code.
- NPM, a package manager for easy consumption of third-party JavaScript libraries.
- Git, a version control system, used for tracking code changes, and collaboration purposes.

#### Installing an IDE

- Visual Studio Code (Free): https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- Atom (Free): https://atom.io/
- Sublime Text (Paid): https://www.sublimetext.com/
- JetBrains WebStorm (Paid): https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/

We recommend Visual Studio Code, it's free and runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms.

#### Installing NodeJS & NPM

NPM is included in NodeJS installers.

- NodeJS (Windows & Mac): https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- NodeJS (Debian and Ubuntu based Linux): https://github.com/nodesource/distributions

On choosing between LTS (long-term-support) vs Current release, we prefer installing the LTS versions for stability.

More info here: https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/

- Test your local NodeJS executable by running `node --version`

```sh
user@group:~$ node --version
v14.4.0
```

- Test your local NPM executable by running `npm --version`

```sh
user@group:~$ npm --version
6.14.5
```

#### Installing Git

Git is pre-installed on some distributions of Linux and Mac.

- Git (Windows, Mac, and Linux): https://git-scm.com/downloads

- Test your local Git executable by running `git --version`

```sh
user@group:~$ git --version
git version 2.25.1
```
